            <h2>Campus Life</h2>
            <p>   As a student at University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, I actively participate in various activities to enhance my academic and personal growth. Two of the clubs I've joined, namely "Sekretariat Rukun Negara" and "Sekretariat Rakan Muda," have allowed me to cultivate essential skills, particularly in the field of media. Through these clubs, I've had the opportunity to develop my communication and leadership skills by organizing and participating in various events, workshops, and campaigns that promote national unity, social awareness, and community engagement. These experiences have been invaluable in complementing my academic pursuits.</p>

            <p>   Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Sciences with a focus on Software Engineering at the university. Despite my active involvement in club activities, I am committed to maintaining a strong academic performance. I recognize the importance of balancing both my extracurricular activities and coursework, as they contribute to my holistic development as a student.</p>
                
            <p>   In addition to my academic and club commitments, I also make time for outdoor activities during the weekends. I enjoy morning walks, camping, hiking, and traveling to explore new places and gain a broader perspective of the world. Food hunting after class is another one of my favorite activities, as it allows me to savor different cuisines and enjoy quality time with friends. These experiences not only help me relax and unwind but also contribute to my personal growth by broadening my horizons and nurturing a well-rounded lifestyle.</p>
